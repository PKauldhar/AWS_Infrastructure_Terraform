This repo shows an example of a simple architecture that was created for aws cloud by using Terraform. This language provides a quick and simple method of creating a cloud network. 

This architecture simply allows a user to ssh onto a public instance and then ssh into a private instance accessable 
only by the same network shared between the public and private network. 


Below you can see simple diagram presenting a visual approach as to how the architecture operates.

The overall task was to create an architecture for aws using Terraform and it was a success.
